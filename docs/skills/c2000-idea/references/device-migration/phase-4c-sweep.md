# Phase 4C — Final Sweep and Clean Build

> You are executing Phase 4C for one target project.
> Phases 4A (all `.h` files) and 4B (all `.c` files) are already complete.
> **Do not re-read phase-4a-headers.md or phase-4b-sources.md. Do not look ahead.**

---

## Your assignment

Perform a final sweep across all migrated files to confirm zero remaining migration
issues, then build the project to confirm it compiles with no errors.

**Stop and ask the user** if any MCP tool call fails or returns an unexpected result.

---

## Briefing fields (confirm before starting)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Target project name | `<project name>` |
| Target project directory | `<absolute path>` |
| Source device | `<e.g. F28003x>` |
| Target device | `<e.g. F28P55x>` |
| Active build config | `<e.g. CPU1_FLASH>` |
| `sysConfigOutputLocation` | `<path — do not run migration report on files here>` |
| All `.h` and `.c` files migrated | `<list from Phase 4A and 4B logs>` |

---

## Reading Migration Collateral links

When fixing a reported issue that has no `Suggested fix`, call:

```
get_migration_guide_section(
  htmlPath = <Migration guide HTML from briefing>,
  anchor   = <symbol name from the #fragment of the Migration Collateral URL>
)
```

The tool returns a Markdown block with the old/new signatures and diff body. Apply
the fix using only that data.

If `Migration guide HTML` is `DOWNLOAD FAILED` or the tool returns an error: ask the
user *"Collateral not available for `{symbol}`. Should I try ti-asm-mcp or the local
SDK header at `<c2000ware_path>/driverlib/<target-device>/driverlib/<module>.h`?"*
and wait for confirmation before proceeding. Never fabricate.

---

## Step 1 — Re-run migration report on all files

Run `get_device_migration_report` (with the absolute file path, source device, and target
device) on every `.h` and `.c` file listed in your briefing
(the files processed in 4A and 4B). In addition, scan the target project directory for
any `.h` or `.c` files **not** in the 4A/4B list — these may have been added or
regenerated after Phase 3 (e.g., new source files the user added). If additional files
are found outside the `sysConfigOutputLocation` folder, outside the SDK path, and outside
the libraries folder (recorded in `c2000-migration.md` as `Libraries folder:`), add
them to the sweep list and run the migration report on them too. Do **not** run the
report on files inside `sysConfigOutputLocation` or the libraries folder — those are
generated outputs or device-compatible libraries that require no migration.

> **`.asm` files are excluded from this sweep.** They were listed in the Phase 4 file
> list with status `MANUAL` during Step 4.1. Do not run `get_device_migration_report`
> on them — the tool does not analyse assembly. Confirm they are logged in
> `c2000-migration.md` as `REVIEW-REQUIRED` and that the user has been notified.
> If any `.asm` file was not logged during Step 4.1 (e.g., added after Phase 3),
> add it to the log now: `REVIEW-REQUIRED: <filename> — assembly file; manual inspection required`

For each file with remaining issues: apply the fix loop from Phase 4B (fix → report →
build → repeat) until clean.

---

## Step 2 — Stuck-sweep guard

Track the total issue count across two consecutive sweeps.

If the issue count is **unchanged across two full sweeps** — the agent is stuck:
- Stop attempting fixes.
- Compile the complete list of unresolved issues (file, line, symbol, reason).
- Report to the user: *"Phase 4C is stuck. The following issues could not be resolved
  after two sweeps. Please review manually."* List every item.
- Record each item in `c2000-migration.md` as `DEFERRED-MANUAL`.
- Proceed to Step 3 (do not block Phase 5 indefinitely).

---

## Step 3 — Review deferred-errors from Phase 4B

Read the deferred-errors list from `c2000-migration.md` (items added during Phase 4B
for cross-file build errors).

For each deferred error:
- Check if it is still present in the current build output.
- If resolved (the file that caused it was migrated): remove from list, note resolved.
- If still present: attempt to fix now, following the same fix loop.
- If unresolvable: escalate to user; record as `DEFERRED-MANUAL`.

---

## Step 4 — Handle inactive-code flags

Check if any remaining report flags are inside inactive code branches:

- **Approach 1** (`#ifdef`): flags inside the source-device branch
  (`#if <source>  //_DEVICE_MIGRATION_`, where `<source>` is the source device name)
  are expected — that branch is inactive on the target device. These are
  **functionally complete**; document them as known inactive-code flags.
- **`#if 0` or comments**: flags here are not active code. Document as inactive.

If the build is clean and only inactive-code flags remain, the migration is
functionally complete. Record in `c2000-migration.md`:
```
Phase 4C: Functionally complete. <N> inactive-code flags remain (expected for Approach 1).
```

---

## Step 4a — Regression baseline check (required)

**Purpose:** Verify that code near the migration fixes was not accidentally deleted or
corrupted during Phase 4A/4B edits. This is a focused spot-check — not a full-file
symbol inventory (which would be impractical for large files).

**For each file that had at least one fix applied in Phase 4A/4B:**

1. **Identify the fixed lines.** From `c2000-migration.md`, collect all
   `[<filename>:<line>] FIXED:` entries for this file. These are the lines that were
   actively edited.

2. **Read ±10 lines of context around each fixed line** in the **target** file. Scan
   that context window for:
   - Lines that appear truncated, duplicated, or obviously malformed (edit artifact).
   - A driverlib function call that was present in the source at that location but is
     now entirely absent in the target (and was NOT itself a flagged symbol).
   - An `#ifdef` / `#endif` that is unclosed or mismatched near the edit.

3. **If a problem is found:**
   - Record it in `c2000-migration.md` as:
     ```
     [<filename>:<line>] REGRESSION: <description> — collateral damage near fix at line <fixed-line>
     ```
   - Restore or repair the affected lines using the source file as reference.
   - Re-run `get_device_migration_report` on that file after the restore to confirm no
     new issues were introduced.

4. **If no problems are found** in all context windows, record:
   ```
   Phase 4C regression check: PASS — no collateral damage found near fix sites.
   ```

> **Scope:** Only check context windows around lines that were actively fixed. Do not
> attempt a full-file symbol inventory — the final build in Step 5 is the authoritative
> final correctness check. This step catches obvious edit artifacts before the build.

---

## Step 5 — Final build (required)

WARNING: **This step is mandatory before declaring Phase 4 complete.**

Call `buildProject` on the target project. 

```
buildProject(<target project name>) 
```

If the build passes: record `Final clean build: PASS` in `c2000-migration.md`.

If the build fails: record `Final clean build: FAIL — <X> errors` in
`c2000-migration.md`. **Do not attempt further fixes here** — return the FAIL result to
the orchestrator so it can dispatch Phase 4D (build error triage).

---

## Step 6 — Update c2000-migration.md

Write the following to `c2000-migration.md`:

```
## Phase 4C — Final Sweep
Sweep result: CLEAN (zero issues) / PARTIAL (<N> inactive-code flags, functionally complete)
Deferred-errors resolved: <M>
Remaining DEFERRED-MANUAL: <K> (see items below)
Final clean build: PASS / FAIL

Phase 4C status: COMPLETE
```

> **Do NOT write `Phase 4 status: COMPLETE` here.** That entry is written by the
> orchestrator in Step 4.6 of `phase-4-migrate-code.md` — after Phase 4D has run
> (if needed). Writing it here prematurely would mark Phase 4 complete before the
> build triage loop has had a chance to resolve remaining errors.

Update the Phase status table for Phase 4C only:
```
| Phase 4C — Sweep | COMPLETE | sweep clean, clean build <PASS/FAIL> |
```

---

## Structured result (required — return to orchestrator)

```
=== Phase 4C Complete ===
Final sweep: CLEAN / PARTIAL
Issues resolved in sweep: <N>
DEFERRED-MANUAL items: <K>
Final clean build: PASS / FAIL   ← orchestrator reads this field to decide whether to dispatch Phase 4D

Phase 4C overall:
  Files migrated: <total>
  Issues found: <total>
  Issues fixed: <total>
  Unresolved / DEFERRED-MANUAL: <total>

c2000-migration.md updated: DONE
```

---

## STOP: Stop here

Your scope ends at the clean build result. Do not read `phase-5-report.md`,
`phase-4d-build-triage.md`, or any other file.

Return your structured result to the **orchestrator** (`phase-4-migrate-code.md`).
The orchestrator will:
- If `Final clean build: PASS` → proceed to Step 4.6 (Phase 4 complete summary).
- If `Final clean build: FAIL` → dispatch Phase 4D (build error triage) via Step 4.5.

**Do not ask the user "Ready to move to Phase 5?" here.** That question is asked by
the orchestrator after Phase 4D has run (or been skipped for a passing build), in
Step 4.6.
